            <p>Enamored at a young age with storytelling, Sarah tortured her family and friends throughout the 90s with re-worked 
              revivals of classics like <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Annie</em> (in which she gracefully accepted the title role). 
              Sarah eventually moved to New York, attended NYU Tisch to study acting, threw out all of her clothing that wasn’t black, 
              and developed a taste for bodega breakfast sandwiches. Sarah writes plays that range from thriller to 80s musical parody 
              and is eager to help others tell their stories.</p>

            <p>A reluctant "techy," Jennifer started life with a strong emphasis on the arts: painting, acting, dance, and drawing 
              (including an unfortunate incident involving a sharpie and her parent's carpet). However, a strong desire and affinity 
              for logic and tech activities flowed though all aspects of life, school and work until she could no longer deny the 
              pull and jumped into the world of web development. Jennifer now focuses on feeding both parts of her soul by creating 
              things that are pleasing and functional.</p>

            <p>Amelita has always had an instinct for management and organization. Beginning her executive career at age four when 
              she dutifully (and, in retrospect, likely annoyingly) pointed out who was off of their line in ballet class, she has 
              honed that intuition through a wide variety of jobs – working in everything from retail and fine dining to musical 
              comedy and film production, with pit stops along the way to pick up some dog training skills and an undergrad degree 
              from NYU. Her non-traditional path (though stressful for her parents) has taught her that following her gut when it 
              comes to ethical values is essential and that this principle too often gets lost within workplaces. While pivoting 
              to coding and design in the chaos of 2020, the idea for The Unbranded presented itself as an opportunity to 
              constructively exercise her management skills, and more importantly put her values into practice. She is incredibly 
              grateful and excited to get to do both with such a remarkable team beside her.</p>
