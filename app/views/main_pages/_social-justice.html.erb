      <p class="social-justice-body">
        Social justice is an integral value at The Unbranded. We believe that ethical business practices and 
        creativity should go hand in hand, and we are dedicated to working with clients and collaborators who 
        believe in creating equity in representation at every level of business. We are committed to removing 
        the gatekeeping of professional marketing services and making them accessible to all creative business 
        owners. Our rate structure and pro-bono work will reflect a sustained dedication to taking on clients 
        from traditionally marginalized groups, and we are always looking for new ways to incorporate positive 
        social justice change into the everyday workings of the business.

        Below you will find links to groups that the co-owners have recently supported. These groups have 
        been vetted as far as any individual could vet a non-profit; we do not have resources beyond what an 
        individual is capable of researching and we reserve the right to rescind links as new information 
        surfaces. As with everything, this is a learning process, and admitting and learning from mistakes is 
        important. <!-- As often as possible, if an organization is removed from our links because of a change of 
        heart, we will share that information on our <a class="sj-a" href ="">blog</a>, which is also where you can find a more comprehensive 
        list of groups we have supported over time.ADD LINK ONCE PAGE CREATED-->
